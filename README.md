# high-school-small-projects
In this repository I uploaded all my small projects of programming. Due to the limits during the upload of the files I failed in tryng to upload the complete project with
all the files. This is not a problem because my main purpose is showing how I coded and what I was thinking during the bulding process. The complete project is contained
in one of my hard disks, ready to be reviewed if it will necessary.
